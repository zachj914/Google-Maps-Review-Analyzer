I have relied on a number of bike shops over the decades and I can say that, while I have been pleased with all but one of them, Pedal Power is by far the best shop of all. Alex, Liam and Josh at the Vernon store deserve your business. I had a problem with a bike I bought from them and they handled it brilliantly. I cannot say enough good things about Pedal Power. Thank you, Guys!

Just bought my first road bike from Middletown Pedal Power, fantastic experience all around! I'm still fairly new to riding and jumping into the world of road bikes was rather overwhelming. Over the course of bike shopping for a couple months I went to several bike shops but kept coming back to Pedal Power. Everyone was genuinely friendly, helpful, and experienced. And most importantly I was able to ask LOTS of questions without ever feeling incompetent, rushed, or pressured in any way.  From the start Alyssa was all around helpful, informed, and resourceful. Kendra was instrumental in getting me up to speed on different features to consider. Bill was super helpful in setting up different sizes of the same bike for me to compare side by side. And Gary spent hours with me throughout the entire process - he is supremely knowledgeable, skilled at explaining it all, and enormously patient (seriously, thank you Gary!)  Thanks to the Pedal Power team, I am entirely confident that I have just the right bike for what I need. Looking forward to many miles on my new Trek Domane!

This is a bike shop where the knowledge, service and professionalism is above and beyond anywhere I have gone.  Despite COVID, their stock for accessories is good!  As an avid cyclist and triathlete, I can say the warm welcome I have seen received by anyone who walks in is beyond compare! Whether buying a training bike for a child, a beginner road bike for your older ones, a road bike for your teen doing her first time sprint triathlon or service for your existing bike, you will be very pleased!  I won‚Äôt go anywhere else!  No matter how busy, their focus on you remains constant when you are being helped!

Very impressed with the customer service. I was browsing on Main Street Middletown and went into the shop and encountered a very knowledgeable and respectful sales person.  we discussed my level of interest and the kind of bike I was looking for and he pointed out several options but one which I really liked. Next week I put a down payment on it and I was able to trade in my old bike to help offset the cost. Within a few days they shipped the bike up to a store near me in Vernon where is able to pick this up and Christmas Eve. Great experience definitely recommend

I recently purchased a new bicycle right in the middle of the pandemic rush on bicycles and the Holiday gift season as well. Even with all of that, I have enjoyed a WONDERFUL experience, a staff that is always engaging, interested, and very knowledgeable about all things cycling!! I never felt rushed in any way and they spent all the time I needed to address my concerns and questions.  And, they also went out of their way to find me accessories and other parts that are scarce at present. I have had the same perfect experience with Pedal Power during bicycle purchases and also previously gaining some racing advice over many years in the past. There are a few bicycle shops closer to me and more local...... BUT none have the high standards and professionalism of PEDAL POWER!! It is always worth my time and effort to travel to one of their shops. Purchasing a bicycle is a HUGE investment and always having a trustworthy knowledgeable team like PEDAL POWER makes the entire experience easy and carefree!!

Very helpful. Provides lots of information and suggestions. Clear explanations of their products. Wide variety of bikes and apparel. They even sell bike trainers as well. 10 out of 10 would recommend. Hope to get my bike serviced here soon.

Well.  The day I went to order it the sales person was super awesome. Told me when I pick it up they would fit it to me and go over incidentals.  He wasn't there when I picked it up and so I never got it adjusted after mentioning it to the sales girl who didn't relay that to the sales guy that cashed me out. He siad here ya go good luck enjoy and went on to take the next customer.  I was not agressive and should have said no lets get this fitted. But I was pretty much bewildered and put off. My bad. But I was expecting a ltitle more help.  So its sitting in my dining room and I look at it everyday. It intimidates me. Im mad and partly blame myself  I wanted to leave confident and ready to ride.

This is the 4th bike that I have purchased from Pedal Power.  I have had excellent customer service and support in the three stores I have purchased from Middletown, Vernon and Berlin.   Whether  I was shopping for a new bike, seeking repairs or upgrades to my bike or just browsing for a future purchase staff has been great answering my questions and pointing me in the right direction.  I highly recommend any of their shops for service or purchasing a new bike

I was very impressed with the Pedal Power staff.  Everyone was knowledgeable and friendly.  I worked with Alyssa and she thoroughly went over the bike I purchased and answered all my questions. It was super busy due to the increased demand for bikes during the pandemic, but they handled it all courteously and efficiently.  I would highly recommend Pedal Power for any cycling needs.

Routinely I receive great customer service, if rating was based on that solely I would certainly give 5 stars. However I am not too pleased with the repair/service provided.  I just paid for their "classic" full tune-up and asked them to keep an eye for whatever could need more fixing. Received bike with no other issues besides wheels being pretty worn. The drivetrain and the frame around it was still pretty filthy, so I took it upon myself to degrease it and clean the frame more. I took the bike out for a ride and brakes had a loud screeching sound so I took the wheels off. The rims and brake pads were still dirty. I also took the time to check the brake pads and they had a shine so I buffed them up with a little sand paper. Screeching disappeared.  I was pretty suspicious about the wear of my chain when taking a look for myself. Bought a park tool chain checker, and sure enough this 5 second test told me the chain is past their "no-go" recommendation of .75% wear. Wasn't really close either.  Paid for tune-up, not even sure what service I received since bike was still dirty, brakes and rims were still filthy which lead to a little sketchy feeling while riding, and chain wasn't checked for wear. Nothing really seemed different at all.  Rather disappointed with the service I received that makes me hesitant about paying for simple maintenance. (Was also displeased with the tune-up my girlfriend received on her bike last year).  It's a let down because the people are great and seem to really care about you.

I had an accident with my bike and parts needed readjusting and I figured I would have to go without my bike for at least a week with all the busy bike repairs due to covid and Spencer left his lunch break early to make all the adjustments needed and had my bike done in about 20 minutes.  I can't say enough about the entire staff at Pedal Power in Middletown Ct, they are always helpful and friendly....I bought a  new bike  here 2 years ago which I love and they helped fix my old 30 year old road bike before the new bike and they do a great job all the time, I highly recommend this bike shop

Pedal Power Willimantic provided great service during COVID. While supplies were limited, they were able to help me find the perfect bike.

I bought bicycle during the height of COVID. I was a newbie, had no idea what I was doing or what I wanted. Matt talked to me on the phone for an hour helping me pick out the right bike because customers weren‚Äôt allowed in the store. Paul spent ages with me looking at accessories and showing me how things worked. Kendra has shared stories about touring that have inspired me. They‚Äôve fixed, tuned, and equipped my bike, which in the last two months has become my most cherished possession, and literally the thing that has gotten me through the pandemic. In September I‚Äôm planning a solo tour from Maine to Connecticut to celebrate a number of changes and milestones in my life. Without Pedal Power, none of this would be possible. I credit them with not only my new hobby, but a happiness I never imagined in my life. Thank you Pedal Power Middletown and all you awesome, welcoming and helpful people. You‚Äôre the best!

I don‚Äôt usually write reviews online but these guys were so great that I can‚Äôt resist! The staff are super helpful, the selection of bikes and gear is great, the prices are fair, and the overall vibe of the shop is friendly and fun.  I was looking for a new mountain bike, having ridden my poor little Giant Boulder for the past 12 years. It was quite a big purchase for me, and I felt out of my comfort zone figuring out which bike would be good for me. The staff (esp Alyssa and Katrin) were really helpful in talking me through the options and my test ride. Even in the midst of the hectic virus situation, everyone I talked to were friendly and attentive. Furthermore, I had an issue with my payment method, which they took the time to resolve, even though it was a hassle for them. It was quite stressful at the time, and I‚Äôm really grateful to Alyssa and the owner for figuring it out. Now I have a gorgeous Salsa Timberjack! I‚Äôm looking forward to bringing my bike here for tune-ups and would definitely recommend this shop.

Came here to get ideas for a new bike for myself, and Tim, (one of the salesmen) couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful and nice. He was very informative and gave me a better idea of what type of bike would fit me best. Plus he let me ‚Äútest drive‚Äù a bike which was awesome. I always enjoy coming here and the people who own this store are very helpful. Will return soon!  Edit:  We came back to this place in March to get a bike for my birthday and the service still didn't disappoint. Everything went smoothly and the sales team was awesome. When I traded in my old bike for a new one the trade in value blew me away! It was $30 more than what I expected! Our sales guy knew what he was talking about and he found the right sized bike for me that would fit in our price range. Once we found the right bike they ordered it online and it arrived in a week. I honestly cant stop riding my bike, it is very comfortable and light! Thanks guys.

I can't compliment Pedal Power of Middletown enough.  Not only did they take my call and answer all my questions over the phone, they were very responsive when I went to the store to take a ride on the bike I ultimately purchased.  Everyone at the store was attentive and took their time to explain all my questions.  I did want the bike but the service they provided was a big part of the reason I finally made my purchase.  I rarely if  ever write reviews but I feel I should if the store has earned it.

I bought my bike at Pedal Power so when my daughter was in need of a new bike we met with Eric who did an outstanding job of educating us about the different options available. After selecting a bike the delivery experience was seamless, he did a great job fitting her and giving hands on demonstration of the bike's features. I would strongly recommend Pedal Power if you are looking for a bike or accessories.

The best staff, knowledge, selection and customer service. I have purchased multiple bikes from them and each time it feels like I‚Äôm dealing with a friend. Every bike I bought has lasted years, and if the bike had a mechanical issue they took care of it right away. I wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere else. Alissa took care of my purchase last time, I decided to go with a gravel bike and her knowledge of the bike was incredible.

Very friendly people with lots of knowledge.

I‚Äôm not big on reviews but these guys deserve a good one. I broke my chain the first day I bought a bike turns out it was something I did loading the bike in my car. They fixed it the same day mid day on a Saturday. I was a little bit demanding and after I realized it was something that I might have done I was instantly humbled. Thanks again for everything and being out there helping people have fun in a crazy time.

I purchased a bike from Pedal Power in Willimantic.  Things are a bit more difficult currently,(Covid 19) but the service manager Montana took great care of me.  We had discussed ahead of time what I was looking for and the choices available.  Based on what I wanted he transferred in to the shop and built 4  different gravel bikes in my size.   I gave him the basic fit measurements from my current bike and he set them up identically.  I was also able to ride 1x and 2x setups, as well as hydraulic and manual disk brakes.  What was even better was being able to get good advice, from someone who knows his stuff.   In the end, I got the bike I wanted, setup and built correctly.  Hard to ask for more.  All around a great experience.

This was one of the most satisfying buying experiences I've had, even though we're all in the middle of virus craziness. I couldn't believe the assistance and knowledge of Alyssa over the phone in helping me choose the correct model. And when I went to pick it up (face shield and all!) the associate noticed my receipt didn't have the serial number on it, and went in to make another receipt! I highly recommend you purchase from them - you won't regret it!

Strange times - one of my twins ( age 15 ) wanted a new Mountain Bike.  We have frequented Pedal Power for our biking needs ... mostly tires, alignments and tune-ups.  We drove to the Vernon location yesterday ( April 16 ) to find they are not allowing customers into the physical store due to the Covid-19 outbreak.  We spoke to a nice gentleman on the phone and said we could do everything online.  My son and I viewed his choice on the Website.  When we got to payment terms - it was PayPal only - which I do not have an account.  We called back to the Vernon store - he took our payment over the phone and informed us we could wait for them to ship the bike up from Middletown or we could drive and get it.  My son and I jumped in the car ... we arrived Middletown to find a new Trek bike for him and they even equipped him with a new helmet.  Great service, Great bike knowledge and most of all ... one happy kid.  I would recommend them to everyone!  GL  Gordon Lunsford

I have had many, many years of excellent customer service, advice and support from Gary, Bill and the Pedal Power team. Yesterday‚Äôs experience at the Middletown location with a new bike purchase and the tune-up of an older bIke was no different than what I‚Äôve come to expect, and it was all done with social distancing. These people know their stuff and are passionate about cycling. I highly, highly recommend Pedal Power.

Great experience, surpassed my high expectations. Have bought my family's bikes from PP for decades and they never disappoint. Went in to "kick tires" about a road bike (mountain bike for 20+ years) and explained my reluctance to spend a nickel on a "new" hobby. Matt took his  time, answered all my questions ("What makes it a 58 cm bike?") and sized me right. He checked their inventory of used bikes and brought out a 2011 Kona Zing. I'm not sure how they made a nickel because the price sealed the deal. I got a new pair of shoes and was out the door. I came back the next day to get my rear brake adjusted (new cable) and am loving my "new" bike. They said come back with any needed adjustments. Looking forward to joining a ride in the Spring.

I wish I could give this business 6+ stars.  They really came through for me on a bicycle I wanted shipped to me.  I live in California, however, a friend of mine lived in Middletown, CT and wanted to give me his bicycle.  I called Pedal Power and spoke to them about my options.  From him dropping the bicycle off, to them packing the bicycle, to the bicycle arriving to my house, Pedal Power was there and helped me get the bike to me fairly quick. They were extremely knowledgeable. Their communication to get the job done was outstanding and their price to do all of this was excellent.  If I lived anywhere close to them, I'd definitely use this place and only this place.  Thank-You and  Well Done!

If you are looking for a new bike and want options along with a knowledgeable team, you MUST come to Pedal Power.  This was my first time visiting the store and I walked out with my new bike!

When it comes to service this place has it figured out. Didn't have the tool I needed in stock. So they sold me one of their own used tools to get me what I needed! I've been to few bike shops in CT. This place and Devils Gear in New Haven know how to treat people. Highly recommended.

I'm new to cycling and I did a lot of research, as well as traveling to different bike shops all over the state, including a few of Pedal Power's locations. Even though they weren't able to price match another shop's discounted price for the bike I wanted, I decided to go with them because they were so helpful and they offered a year of free service/tune ups which I think more than covers the difference in price I paid. They have quite a few locations so no matter where I end up cycling, I won't ever be too far away if I need some service done. The sale was zero pressure and they spent a ton of time just answering my questions before I ever committed to buying through them. I'm very happy with my overall experience from the first time I walked into the door without a clue what my options were to the day I picked up my bike.  They also offer some classes that are free to people who are part of their customer reward program which I intend to take advantage of. Some of the classes you have to pay for, but it's generous of them to offer some free ones to loyal customers. I feel like by buying through them, I have a network of very capable people to help me out when I need them. I'm sure there are other very helpful shops out there, but I don't see why I would feel the need to go to another place when I sort of feel like I'm part of the Pedal Power "community."  As a newbie to the hobby, I felt completely at ease and would recommend this place to anyone!

Purchased my first mountain bike in 10 years from pedal power in Essex. Staff was super helpful and most importantly they weren't a bunch of pushy car salesman. they explained what they had and answered all questions and only made suggestions based on what I was looking for. I visited the store multiple times in search for what u was looking for. Each time, I worked with a different staff member and they all were more than willing to drop what they were doing to help the customers.  After the bike was picked out, they even helped find a helmet that fit correctly for me and my 6 year old son. Definitely returning for future purchaes

I'm a 58-year-old woman. In a previous lifetime, I was a pretty fit long distance cyclist, but time and other pursuits shifted that reality.  Last week I bravely headed down to Pedal Power and spoke with Paul about a new bicycle. He helped me find one that would be perfect for me, and I picked it up in the Essex shop later the same day.  In both shops, I was incredibly impressed with the service and attention I received. Nervous about being out of shape and intimidated by what I feared would be some Young Whippersnapper Cool Guys‚Ñ¢, I was happily pleased to find otherwise. No one tried to sell me anything I didn't need. Everyone was kind, and even more importantly, never condescending.  I felt encouraged and inspired - exactly as one should feel when making such a purchase.  Five stars and more for the amazingly helpful folks at Pedal Power. I'm guessing that they have already changed my life.

Looking forward to be dealing with them in the future-- They will be serving my e-trike. HERB EVANS

I had an amazing experience purchasing my bicycle at Pedal Power!!! If you want expert advice than Pedal Power is the place to go! I purchased a P1 and went through a comprehensive bike fitting and learned sooooooo much more about riding in the process. The staff are so down to earth and they do not make you feel incompetent when you ask questions. I would recommend that if anyone wants a great experience whether you are buying a new bike, accessories or just need general advice, Pedal Power is definitely the place you want to go!!! Oh and in my experience, it doesnt really matter which location you go to (I've gone to the Middletown and Vernon stores) the consistency in excellence is something that you can expect!

I've lived and ridden all over the country and this is easily the best bike shop i've ever been too.  Better deals than the more pricier shops on the shore. I saved SO much money on a new bike and still love it 4 years later. Phenominal!

Called and confirmed bike rack I wanted was in stock.  Went there and had a pleasant experience.  Paid for the rack and was helped to put it on my vehicle.  Everyone at Pedal Power is very helpful.

Fantastic customer service and commitment to excellence.  I asked my in-laws to help me get my bikes to Pedal Power for some work / assembly, but miscommunicated with my in-laws about what I wanted and Pedal Power wound up doing more than I expected. I was blown away by Pedal Power's commitment to excellence and customer service - a quick phone call and e-mail cleared up all the issues and left everyone happy.

The staff at Pedal Power is passionate, knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful. I purchased a bicycle from them about three weeks ago and received an excellent deal on a great bike. Since then I have bought many accessories which may or may not be expensive but I can tell you I have never been pressured by an upsale. They do thorough repairs and have always been friendly. I highly recommend them for anyone who is looking at getting into the hobby. I know I am hooked!

Best place to buy a bike! The team is very knowledgeable, and gave me great recommendation on which bicycle would fit my needs. They were not pushy at all. Prices are very reasonable regardless if you are buying a bike or accessories. Try them out, you won't get disappointed.

New to recreational biking, and looked to Pedal Power in Middletown for research and advice.  Went prepared to make deposit on 3 bikes and gear, and was very pleased by the great attention, knowledge and time that Paul and his colleagues took to help us find just what we needed.  No pressure sales, just highly competent staff and quality products, and a year of free service on each bike.  This place is a treasure.  Thank you Paul, and crew.

Just recently bought our sixth and seventh bikes from these fine folks. There is no part of Pedal Power I can take issue with. These are truly some fine people who obviously are passionate about what they do, and as a result do it very well.  They will never oversell you on something and the service is second to none.  OK I'll give them 4.9995 stars (I wish they were open one more evening during the week- every other Monday would rock).

Paul helped me at the store. He is a professional and representated the store well. The store is stocked with a ton of different stuff and Paul helped me to choose the correct equipment that best suited my needs. He also is very knowledgable about all of the warranties of the items i was interested in. Paul helped me understand the recommended service intervals as well as the maintenance and proper setup on my new bike.  He set up all my equipment and did it with a smile. He was very personable and I enjoyed my time at the store. I would recommend pedal power to any new or veterans cyclers looking for a quality in store experience.

Right before a big ride, I discovered that I had brake issues.  Usually not a big deal... but I was leaving in a few hours to head to NY.  I was riding in the 5 Boro Bike Tour the next day.  So, I called up Pedal Power in Middletown, explained my brake issues and they told me to bring it right down.  When I arrived, I met up with Spencer and right away he put my bike up on the stand and in 20 minutes or so he fixed the issue.  This isn't the first time I had exceptional service.  I highly recommend Pedal Power for any type of service needed on your bike.

I brought a spin bike in for this bike shop to look at. I didn't even have to help take it out of the car- they did that for me. Gary looked at and tried the bike out for me. He tightened up the seat and let me know there were no problems with it- I just have to ride it. Now he could have "taken me for a ride" (get it? lol) BUT he didn't. He said he did not feel right doing work on the bike and charging me! What a stand up guy and business. I would recommend this honest bike shop to all.

I bought a second hand Trek road bike from a friend that I rode for several years, but never really loved it.  I brought the bike to Pedal Power and got a fitting with Gary.  He took the time to talk to me about my riding routines and my riding goals.  He asked what I liked and didn't like about the feel of the bike.  With that information, he then spent time taking measurements and having me hop on and off the bike, trying different settings and fittings.  The cost for the upgrades was very reasonable.  I've been riding now for three months and I couldn't be happier.  It turns out I do like bike riding!  I highly recommend Pedal Power.

Kendra, Peter and Tom at Pedal Power in Essex are the best in Connecticut. I had first begun shopping for a Biria bike at another local competitor's store in Old Saybrook. What a difference in the sales team's expertise and customer service between the two shops! At Pedal Power, I felt like someone was actually paying attention to me and that they knew what they were talking about. At the competitor's shop, I had to wait to talk to the person who knew something, and half the time they were on the telephone with someone else. The entire Pedal Power team are bicycle experts; at the competitor's place they hire high school students. At Pedal Power, they had 4 experts on staff and in the store to help people; at the other store there were only 2 sales people (1 who knew anything.)  Another reason why I'm so glad that I bought my bike at Pedal Power is because they are so good to the communities they do business in. I've been to three fundraisers where Pedal Power donated bikes or equipment to the cause including my daughter's elementary school, The Buttonwood Tree (an arts venue), and Middlesex Community College.  The last reason why I give 5 stars to Pedal Power is because they are caring people. I had a little slip and fall and skinned my knee while visiting, and the whole team took great care of me and bandaged me up. They are just great, smart people who care.

Anyone interested in getting a bicycle repaired will not be disappointed with the staff here they're all knowledgeable, and they are also reasonable in pricing

I am relatively new to road biking and have made a few mistakes with equipment. The knowledgeable and patient  folks from Pedal Power have been very helpful. Everything about shopping at the store has proven to be a very positive experience for me.  I would like to point out the remarkable difference in by bicycle following their overhaul. My goodness the bike looked and drove as if the bike was brand new, maybe better.  My one regret is that I did not go to them when I was looking for a bike and purchasing it new. Hind sight is  20 20. If you are looking for a bike, these guys and gals are great.

I first went to PP shortly after moving back to Central Connecticut, about 11 years ago (2001).  From then until now, I have had nothing but outstanding experiences with them.  From buying a water bottle to a bike, the owners and staff spend the time to make sure you are getting what you want/need/desire.  The shop rides are a great experience, and the other events are a blast (Bikes & Beer)...  I HIGHLY recommend Pedal Power to anyone I like who is interested in bikes.  Everyone else I send others to Newington Bike Shop.

You won't find a better shop in CT!  The staff (from the owners, to the mechanics, to the sales staff on the floor) are all super friendly and know their stuff.  Monday night road rides are a blast as are Tuesday mountain rides (lights necessary in fall and winter!).  Stop in and tell 'em Randee sent ya!
